Mobile Motion Tracking Robot Arm 
Fall 2015 Senior Design 
Jeff Ruocco, Jeff Falberg, Getro Jean-Bapiste 

Overview 
.Microsoft Kinect motion tracking used to control the 
movement of a robot arm 
.Five degrees of freedom 
.Robot arm attached to mobile platform controlled by 
the user 
.Wireless communication between computer and 
microcontroller through XBee modules 

Overview 

Microsoft Kinect Skeletal Tracking 
.Microsoft Kinect uses a technique called structured 
light to do skeletal tracking 

Microsoft Kinect Skeletal Tracking 
.IR emitter emits a pattern of infrared light 
.IR depth sensor detects light and creates depth map 

Microsoft Kinect Skeletal Tracking 
.Kinect compares generated depth map to training 
examples to determine body parts 
.Assigns joints based on body parts 

Microsoft Kinect Skeletal Tracking 
.Microsoft SDK 
// Enable skeletal tracking 
KinectSensor kinect = null; 
kinect.SkeletonStream.Enable(); 
// Access skeletal information 
SkeletonFrame skeletonFrame = e.OpenSkeletonFrame(); 
skeletonFrame.CopySkeletonDataTo(this.skeletonData); 

Wireless Data Communication 
.Wireless data communication will be done with a Digi 
International XBee 802.15.4 module 
.The XBee transmitter module operates on a 2.4GHz 
radio frequency to transmit data to a receiver 
.The receiver communicates with the microcontroller 
mounted on the robot 
.Xbee module is compatible with our Lynxmotion SSC-
32U servo controller 

Servo Controller: Lynxmotion SSC-32U 
.SSC-32U can control up to 32 
servo channels as well as 
having 8 analog I/O ports 
.Bidirectional communication 
with query commands, 
synchronized, or “group” 
moves 
.Motion controls can be 
immediate response, speed 
controlled, timed motion, or a 
combination 

Servo Controller: Lynxmotion SSC-32U 
.Group moves allow any combination of servos to begin 
and end motion simultaneously 

SSC-32 Servo Sequencer 
.Free utility to manipulate the motion of the arm 
.Moves servos, calibrate their positions, store and 
playback motion sequences 
.We will program the utility to control motors based on 
commands received from XBee module 

Alternative 
.As an alternative, we can use an Arduino 
microcontroller to control the SSC-32U server 
controller 
.Program Arduino, sends serial commands to the SSC-
32U, which in turn controls the servos 

Robot Arm: Lynxmotion AL5D 
.Arm has 5 servos, one for each motion 
.180 degree rotation at the base 
.Forward and backwards 
.Up and down 
.Open and close gripper 
.Rotate gripper at the wrist 
.Each servo has three wires. Two for power (voltage 
and ground), and a pulse signal controlled by the 
microcontroller to turn servo on/of 
.Microcontroller and servos will be powered by a 
6.0vdc battery pack 

Mobile Platform 
.4WD platform to transport the 
arm 
.Microcontroller will control 
platform servos through a motor 
controller 
.Motor controller has two 
channels, turn and forward, that 
are connected to output pins on 
microcontroller 
.Platform servos powered by 
12.0vdc battery 

Mobile Platform 
.A wireless camera will be attached to the mobile 
platform to allow the user to monitor the arm from a 
distance 
.The camera will send video over a 2.450GHz radio 
frequency to a computer 
.The camera will be powered by a 9.0vdc battery pack
