# Mobile-Motion-Tracking-Robot-Arm
Senior design project by Jeffery Ruocco, Jeffrey Falberg, and Getro Jean-Bapiste.

Our team successfully created a mobile motion controlled robot arm.  The robot arm will imitate the movement of the user's hand, allowing the user to control the robot arm simply by moving their hand to the desired position.  Motion tracking on the user's hand is done by the Microsoft Kinect, while inverse kinematic and linear regression calculations are performed on an Arduino Uno.
