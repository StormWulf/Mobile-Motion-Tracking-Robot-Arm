Kinect Coordinate Mapping
=========================

This project demonstrates Kinect for Windows coordinate mapping using SDK version 1.8.

Learn how to draw the joints on screen and PERFECTLY align them with the color or depth frame.

    foreach (Joint joint in body.Joints)
    {
        // 3D coordinates in meters
        SkeletonPoint skeletonPoint = joint.Position;

        // 2D coordinates in pixels
        Point point = new Point();

        if (_mode == CameraMode.Color)
        {
            // Skeleton-to-Color mapping
            ColorImagePoint colorPoint = _sensor.CoordinateMapper.MapSkeletonPointToColorPoint(
                                                                  skeletonPoint,
                                                                  ColorImageFormat.RgbResolution640x480Fps30);

            point.X = colorPoint.X;
            point.Y = colorPoint.Y;
        }
        else if (_mode == CameraMode.Depth)
        {
            // Skeleton-to-Depth mapping
            DepthImagePoint depthPoint = _sensor.CoordinateMapper.MapSkeletonPointToDepthPoint(
                                                                  skeletonPoint,
                                                                  DepthImageFormat.Resolution320x240Fps30);

            point.X = depthPoint.X;
            point.Y = depthPoint.Y;
        }
    }
